# Python-Data-analysis--Udacity-Who-can-be-successfull-to-pass-the-project

Three CSV contained the information of the student who studied in Udacity:
1) Enrollments 2) daily_engagement 3)projects submissions

Task completed:
1) import data as list of dictionary
2) fixed data type: from string to int/float
3) cleaned data: remove the "test" data, removed unpaied student, extract the data including only first week info
4) use defaultdict() to group the data based on student's ID(account_key)
5) use numpy for the statistics: mean, STD, min, max
6) compared the data between student who pass the project and those who didnot and found some tentative conclusion based on the minutes they spend on study,days visited the classroom, and the lessons completed.
7) However, further study is needed to validate with the statistics analysis. A/B testing need to be conducted to find out the casiation of the factors.Maching learning could be applied to predict what kind of the student is more likely to pass the project.
